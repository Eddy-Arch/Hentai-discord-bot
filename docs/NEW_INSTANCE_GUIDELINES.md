# Creating a new instance:
The following is a guideline we hope you abide by when making a new instance.
### Add something new (if possible)
Changes and improvements are welcome. You must make sure your instance has
a github repo that is public for everyone to see, before we can add your instance
to the instances list.
### Host it yourself
The idea is to have a lot of instances, hosted by different people.
This repo will be the upstream, and everyone else will have their own spins on
the bot, hosted on different servers.
However, for now, we are willing to host your instance for now, on our servers.
### Actually doing it
for the repo, add your changes, and then make a pull request with the invite
link, github repo and website(if there is one) listed in INSTANCES.md
